PHISHING
***************************************************
When identifying phishing characteristics in a suspicious email, look for the following red flags:

1. Urgent or threatening tone: Phishing emails often try to create a sense of urgency or panic to prompt immediate action.
2. Suspicious sender: Check the sender's email address. Legitimate emails usually come from a company's official domain, not a generic or suspicious-looking address.
3. Generic greeting: Phishing emails often use generic greetings like "Dear customer" instead of addressing you by name.
4. Spelling and grammar errors: Legitimate emails usually don't have typos or grammatical errors.
5. Suspicious links or attachments: Be cautious of links or attachments that ask you to download software, provide login credentials, or reveal sensitive information.
6. Request for sensitive information: Legitimate companies rarely ask for sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, or personal data via email.
7. Mismatched or fake URLs: Check the URL of any links to ensure they match the company's official website.
8. Lack of personalization: Phishing emails often lack personalization or specific details that a legitimate company would know about you.

If you identify any of these characteristics, it's best to:

- Delete the email
- Not click on any links or attachments
- Verify the email's authenticity with the company directly
